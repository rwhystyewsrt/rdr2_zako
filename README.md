# Red Dead Redemption 2 Screenshot Extraction and Decryption
This tool is used to batch extract and decrypt the screenshots taken with the F6 key in-game and convert them to standard JPEG format.
Theoretically compatible with Rockstar Games, Epic Games Launcher, and Steam versions of the game. Currently only tested with the Steam version.
